### What is Cinemascan?

A movie plot genre classifier using the CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset and IMDB Dataset!

The project was initially created as a Final Project for MAIS202, but wanting to continue it, I decided to work on it more!

If you have questions about the project or recommendations email me at philip.tam.code@gmail.com or add me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiptamcode/
